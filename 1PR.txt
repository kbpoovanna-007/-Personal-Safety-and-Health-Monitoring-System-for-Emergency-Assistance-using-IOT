1. Include necessary libraries and define constants and variables.

2. Setup function:
    a. Initialize serial communication.
    b. Initialize ESP8266 serial communication.
    c. Print "AT" command to ESP8266 and wait for response.
    d. If ESP8266 responds with "OK":
        i. Call connectWiFi() function.
        ii. Call interruptsetup() function.
  
3. connectWiFi() function:
    a. Send AT command to set WiFi mode.
    b. Send AT command to connect to the specified SSID and password.
    c. Wait for response and check if connection is successful.
    d. Return true if connection is successful, otherwise return false.

4. interruptsetup() function:
    a. Configure Timer2 to generate interrupts.
    b. Set the interrupt service routine.

5. ISR(TIMER2_COMPA_vect) function:
    a. Disable PWM and set Timer2 to CTC mode.
    b. Read analog input from pulse sensor.
    c. Update sampleCounter and lastBeatTime.
    d. Determine peak and trough of pulse wave.
    e. Calculate IBI and BPM.
    f. Update runningTotal and rate array.
    g. Set QS flag.
    h. Update amplitude and thresholds.
    i. Reset variables if necessary.

6. loop() function:
    a. Start a label "start".
    b. Reset error variable.
    c. Print BPM and send BPM data to ThingSpeak.
    d. Call updatebeat() function.
    e. If error occurs during updatebeat(), go to label "start".
    f. Delay for 1 second before next iteration.

7. updatebeat() function:
    a. Send TCP connection command to ESP8266.
    b. If no error in connection:
        i. Send data to ThingSpeak.
    c. If error occurs, close connection and set error flag.

8. Error handling:
    a. If error occurs during TCP connection or data transmission, retry the operation.
